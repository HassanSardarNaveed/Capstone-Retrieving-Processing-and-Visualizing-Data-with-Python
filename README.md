In this capstone project, I applied my knowledge from the Python for Everybody Specialization to create comprehensive data solutions. 
Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
University of Michigan | Instructor: Charles Russell Severance

As part of the "Python for Everybody" Specialization on Coursera, this capstone course provided hands-on experience in retrieving, processing, and visualizing data using Python. Key learning outcomes included understanding Unicode characters, building search engines, and creating email data visualizations. Throughout the course, I developed strong skills in data analysis, Python programming, database management, and data visualization, culminating in a capstone project that involved creating a series of applications to manipulate and visualize data. This project emphasized practical experience with Python 3 and incorporated elements like the Google PageRank algorithm, data spidering, and dynamic visualizations.

Key Skills Developed:

Data Analysis
Python Programming
Database Management (DBMS)
Data Visualization
